An Algo Project at Codam (42) - Data Science and Logistic Regression.

Objective is to learn about data analysis by recreating `Pandas`'s function `describe`, to visualize data using histograms, scatter plots and pair plots, and to learn how data classification works while reimplementing logistic regression functions: `logreg_train` to train the model, `logreg_predict` to use trained model for prediciton.
